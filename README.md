## 🧠 About the Work:
**Breach Harmonics** is a model that explores how systems decay not in chaos—but in silence. It detects:

- Narrative fatigue & echo loss
- Substrate dependencies of belief
- Structural trust erosion at system level
- Silent collapse patterns before crisis headlines

This file is part of a multi-year investigation across international corporate structures, narrative integrity, and system resonance behaviors.
