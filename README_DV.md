# DV: Dependency Vector Framework  
*A Substrate-Level Diagnostic for Coherence Drift*

> *Collapse is rarely loud. It begins with substrate dissonance — and DV listens for it.*

This framework introduces **DV (Dependency Vector)** — a layered analytic tool for detecting systemic fragility **before** failure surfaces.  
It operates across nested tiers:

- **Cᵢ (Cohesion/Dependence)**: Measures structural reliance on internal and external substrates  
- **Vᵢ (Volatility/Instability)**: Detects how turbulent or threatened those substrates are  
- **ΔDV Drift**: Identifies early-stage rupture signals, even in seemingly stable systems  

DV is applicable to:

- Corporate and economic modeling  
- National policy foresight  
- Narrative stability and mythic resonance tracking  
- Civilizational stress-testing

> This is not a prediction engine — it is a **resonance scanner**.

## Usage  
Read the core logic in `DV_Final_Document.docx`.  
Use it to model signal integrity, collapse conditions, or systemic drift.
